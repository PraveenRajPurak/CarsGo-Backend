How to run the project ?

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Make sure to be in the same directory as go.mod i.e., CarsGo-Backend.
3. Run "Go mod tidy" to get all the packages used in the application.
4. Either build an image using docker build command - "docker build -t Praveenrajprp/carsgo:{YOUR_VERSION} ." or Go to step 5. (Or Modify the dockerfile to suit your conditions)
5. Before running to docker compose command, make sure to be in the same directory as the compose file i.e., "devopstools" directory.
6. Run docker-compose -f connect.yaml up
7. The container will be up and running. 
8. Test the routes using postman. (If you don't change port in the dockerfile, then it would run on localhost:10010)
